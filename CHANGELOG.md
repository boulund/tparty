# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project loosely adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).  
The version numbering scheme consists of three numbers separated by dots:
`major.minor.patch`. Major versions are incremented when a substantial change
in overall functionality of StaG-mwc is introduced. Minor versions are
incremented for any modifications to the interface or output files (i.e.
changes that would likely lead to different output for end-users when
re-running an analysis, either by giving error messages or changing output
files), and the patch version is typically incremented for any set of changes
committed to the master branch that does not trigger any of the aforementioned
situations.
