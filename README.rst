TTT proteotyping pipeline
=========================
This repository contains the components of "The Tailored Treatment
Proteotyping Pipeline", TPARTY, for automated proteotyping analysis of 
samples in `The Tailored Treatment`_ project.

Installation
************
Detailed installation instructions are available in the `online
documentation`_. 

Clone the repository to obtain a copy of the code and scripts::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/chalmersmathbioinformatics/tparty

Dependencies
------------
The pipeline depends on a number of Python packages and external programs, most
notably:

  * ReAdW (raw to mzXML conversion)
  * X!Tandem mass-spectrometry search engine (mzXML to peptides)
  * BLAT (sequence alignment)
  * `TCUP`_
